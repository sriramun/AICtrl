# AICtrl
A Computer Vision based Gamepad Emulator


## About
Handheld controllers are rather restrictive, and are often expensive to get hold of. AICtrl provides an alternate solution based on the concepts of Computer Vision, allowing users to map postures and gestures (relayed through a webcam) to XInput controls. The end result guarantees a more relaxing, customizable, and affordable gaming experience.

This alternative solution also caters to those gamers who may not be able to physically hold a controller due to disabilities.
