# AICtrl
A Computer Vision based Gamepad Emulator


## About
Handheld controllers are rather restrictive, and are often expensive to get hold of. AICtrl provides an alternate solution based on the concepts of Computer Vision, allowing users to map postures and gestures (relayed through a webcam) to XInput controls. The end result guarantees a more relaxing, customizable, and affordable gaming experience.

This alternative solution also caters to those gamers who may not be able to physically hold a controller due to disabilities.

## Scope 
* Once there's support for more virtual HIDs, the set of use cases will be greatly diversified. For example, users can map sign language to human readable text (gestures mapped to sequences of keystrokes), or use their eyes to control a mouse cursor.
* Hand articulation combined with various holistic postures and gestures can give rise to countless unique combinations, each capable of being mapped to a control. The project can aim to make a greater set of such combinations available to the end user â€” greatly increasing customizability.
